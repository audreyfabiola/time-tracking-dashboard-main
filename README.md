## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS Vanilla

### What I learned

By doing this challenge, I was able to implement basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS. Also, I was able to learn how JSON works for the first time.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to improve my coding skills. I also would like to try this challenge by implementing CSS Grid instead of flexbox, as I heard that it is a better choice than using a flexbox layout.
